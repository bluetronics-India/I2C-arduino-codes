The example script will allow you to send text to the screen via I2C. It is very similar to my scripts for the normal 16×2 screen.



Step 1 - Give connections and download the program

To download the script directly to your Pi you can use :
wget https://bitbucket.org/MattHawkinsUK/rpispy-misc/raw/master/python/lcd_i2c.py


Step 2 – Enable the I2C Interface

In order to use I2C devices you must enable the interface on your Raspberry Pi. This can be done by following my “Enabling The I2C Interface On The Raspberry Pi” tutorial. By default the I2C backpack will show up on address 0x27.

Step 3 – Run Script

Running the script can be done using :

sudo python lcd_i2c.py


other programs to try:

#!/usr/bin/env python
import LCD1602
import time

def setup():
	LCD1602.init(0x27, 1)	# init(slave address, background light)
	LCD1602.write(0, 0, 'Greetings!!')
	LCD1602.write(1, 1, 'from Bluetronics')
	time.sleep(2)

def loop():
	space = '                '
	greetings = 'Thank you for attending this training programme! ^_^'
	greetings = space + greetings
	while True:
		tmp = greetings
		for i in range(0, len(greetings)):
			LCD1602.write(0, 0, tmp)
			tmp = tmp[1:]
			time.sleep(0.8)
			LCD1602.clear()

def destroy():
	pass	

if __name__ == "__main__":
	try:
		setup()
		while True:
			pass
	except KeyboardInterrupt:
		destroy()
